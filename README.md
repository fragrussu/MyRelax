# MyRelax
"Myelin and Relaxation" (MyRelax) is a collection of command line scripts written in Python 3 for myelin and relaxometry MRI. MyRelax was developed as part of the CDS-QuaMRI project (http://cds-quamri.eu), funded under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 634541.

MyRelax tools require MRI scans in NIFTI format, as well as other MRI sequence parameters that are passed to MyRelax routines as text files. These can be readily obtained from DICOM fields or from the JSON files associated to NIFTIs when the Brain Imaging Data Structure is adopted (BIDS https://bids.neuroimaging.io).
