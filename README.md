# MyRelax: overview
"Myelin and Relaxation" (MyRelax) is a collection of command line scripts written in Python 3 for myelin and relaxometry MRI. MyRelax was developed as part of the [CDS-QuaMRI project](http://cds-quamri.eu), funded under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 634541.

MyRelax tools process MRI scans in NIFTI format, as well as other MRI sequence parameters that are passed in the form of text files. These can be readily obtained from DICOM fields or from the JSON files associated to NIFTIs when the Brain Imaging Data Structure is adopted ([BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io)).

# MyRelax: dependencies
You will need a Python 3 distribution such as [Anaconda](http://www.anaconda.com/distribution) as well as the following third party modules/packages:
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [Nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel)
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable)


# Installation (Linux and MacOS)
Gettins MyRelax is extremely easy.

1. Open a terminal;
2. Navigate to your destination folder;
3. Clone MyRelax:
```
git clone https://github.com/fragrussu/MyRelax.git 
```
4. MyRelax is ready for you in `./MyRelax`. MyRelax scripts are in: 
```
./MyRelax/myrelax
```
5. You should now be able to use the code. Try to print the manual of `getMTV.py` to make sure:
```
python ./MyRelax/myrelax/getMTV.py --help
```
